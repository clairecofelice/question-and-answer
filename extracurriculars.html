    <p> No matter what grade you're in or what your interests are, there is a wide variety of extracurricular
      opportunities on campus for you. There are two great ways to learn more about what's going on on campus
      and learn how to join.</p>

      <ol>
        <li><b> Visit the Activities Fair: </b> Once a semester, all of the clubs and organizations host an activities
          fair during which students can visit tables and speak to representatives for each activity. This is an extremely
          fun and easy way of not only finding out more about clubs you may have already wanted to join but also to discover
          what other opportunities are out there that you may have never thought about before.</li>

        <li><b> Explore Portfolio: </b> Portfolio is the university's main source of information on all of the clubs, activities,
          and events going on on campus. By logging in with your university username and password, you will get immediate access
          to a directory of all of these clubs and organizations, with links to their websites and information for who to contact
          should you want to get involved. So when you have some extra time, go to https://portfolio.wustl.edu/ and see what new
          things you may want to get involved in. </li>

    <p> For up-to-date information on WashU's athletic schedule and rankings, click <a href ="http://bearsports.wustl.edu/landing/index"> here! </a>

    <p> And if, at the end of the day, none of these activities seem right for you, you're welcome to start your
      own club or intramural team. </p>
