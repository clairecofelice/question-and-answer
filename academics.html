  <h1> Freshman Students </h1>
    <p> For those of you entering your first year of college, one of the biggest changes is likely having
      much more control over your academic schedule. At WashU, in particular, students in any of the four
      undergraduate programs can and are encouraged to take classes in other discplines. This means that
      each semester, over 1500 courses are available to choose from when making your schedule. If you're
      having trouble siftng through the extensive course listings and are unsure of how to proceed, here
      are some tips to make sure you start first semester off in the right direction: </p>

    <ol>
      <li><b> Get started early: </b> WashU offers two summer programs to incoming freshman that are geared
        toward helping you have a stress-free academic transition to school. The first, <a href="http://firstyear.wustl.edu/Orientation/Pages/SOAR.aspx">
          SOAR </a>, or Summer Orientation, Advising, Registration Program, is an on-campus, 3-day overnight experience
          that gives freshman the chance to get academic advising, register early for classes, and meet future peers
          all before school stars in the fall. If you have more time over the summer and are interested in getting ahead
          by earning credits before school starts, you may want to consider The Freshman Summer Academic Program, or
          <a href="http://pages.wustl.edu/fsap"> FSAP </a>. FSAP is a five-week academic program that allows
          incoming freshman to live on campus, explore St. Louis, and earn up to six academic credits. During this time,
          advising is also available to help you register for fall classes.
      <li><b> Speak to your advisor(s): </b> Don't be afraid to reach out to your advisor before the school year begins. Even if you
        aren't able to attend one of the summer programs, you can always contact your advisor or other faculty members over the summer
        via email. Regardless of what school you are in, you will be contacted mid-summer with the name of your four-year advisor
        who is more than happy to answer any questions about scheduling, specific classes, and your four-year plan. No matter what your
        question is, your four-year advisor is always a great first line of contact because they can easily direct you to other
        faculty and/or resources if they don't personally have an answer for you.
      <li><b> Reach out to your peers: </b> It's always comforting to remember that you're not alone while you're going through this process â€“
        over 1500 other students are in the same position as you and most certainly have many of the same questions as you. Joining social
        media groups for your class and the entire WashU community is one of the easiest ways to get in touch with other students.
        Whether you have a specific question that you'd like to ask or just want to see what other questions people are asking,
        these social media groups provide a wealth of information to you before getting to school. </p>

        <p> Another great way of getting in touch with peers before the school year begins is by attending the new student events held in cities near you. Often times, families of current students
        will host dinners or information sessions in their home states that are available to all prospective students. So don't feel shy about
        stopping by and hearing how others are handling the process. You'd be surprised by how many WashU students are also living in your area.


  <h1> Transfer Students </h1>
    <p> If you're transfering to WashU after attending another university for some time, you probably already have some idea of what the college
      experience is like. However, every school is incredibly different and classes at WashU may be nothing like those at your previous school.
      Like freshman, transfer students will take part in an orientation program during the first few days of the academic year. </p>

      

  <h1> Exchange Students </h1>
    <p> Whether you're only planning on studying at WashU for a semester or are staying for an entire year, your time in St. Louis is limited,
      so you want to make the most out of it! Considering you will be receiving your degree from another university, you're likely already
      familiar with the courses you need to take during your time here. However, to make sure that you have a problem-free time abroad, we have
      several resources for you:

      <ol>
          <li><b> Buddy system: </b> All exchange students will be paired with a current, upper-class student at the university, who will be there
            to make sure that you know all of the academic deadlines and are familiar with campus opportunities. They'll also help organize
            events, so that you can get in touch with other students involved with exchange programs. </li>
          <li><b> Language resources: </b> For any nonnative English speakers who would like to strengthen their English proficiency, the university
            has an on-campus organization called English Corner that meets at both the Danforth and Medical campuses every Monday. Each meeting lasts
            two hours and gives students a chance to participate in free, informal English conversation practice. Also, the meetings are free and require
            no registration or RSVP, so it's definitely worth stopping by one day to see whether they may be helpful to you. </li>
