        <p> During the first few months at school, it's easy to get caught up with academics, social, activities, and more.
          However, it's always important to step back and make sure that you're taking care of yourself. Regardless of your grade and whether or
          not you live on campus, you may visit the university's health center, which provides a range of services
          including medical checkups and mental health counseling.

          House in the South 40 and is open from 9am to 3pm on weekdays. Students are free to schedule
          appointments using the Student Health Service's online portal or walk-in and be seen by a doctor
          at any time. The Quadrangle Pharmacy can also be found inside the Habif Center and can handle
          all medication-related needs. If you would like to contact the health center, you can call the number
